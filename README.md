    Student at Northeastern University working towards a CS and Media Arts Combined Degree. Currently 
    learning how to develop a personal website, and I am interested in different rendering strategies,
    and 3d projections onto a 2d plane, which is probably going to be my next project. I am interested
    in Web Dev, Mobile App Dev, Game Dev, and Rendering engines, but I am generally interested in any
    field that I am able to learn more CS ideas from and use creative problem solving.
